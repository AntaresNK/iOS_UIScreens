## Description
The Weather Forecast App Design is a single-page concept for displaying the current weather in a specified location, along with a reference to the weekly forecast. 
This design concept focuses on aesthetics, using the Overpass font, gradient backgrounds, and shadow effects to create an engaging and visually appealing user interface.
## Features
**Current Weather Display:** The app design prominently displays the current weather conditions in the specified location. Users can quickly glance at the temperature, weather description, and any additional information on wind speed and rain possibility.

**Weekly Forecast:** Below the current weather display, the design includes a section for the weekly forecast. Users can see a brief summary of the upcoming week's weather, providing a quick overview of what to expect.

**Notifications:** The app includes a notification feature that allows users to receive important weather alerts and updates. Users can stay informed about weather changes, ensuring their safety and preparedness.

**Aesthetic Elements:** The design incorporates the following aesthetic elements to enhance the user experience:

- **Overpass Font:** Overpass font is used for text elements throughout the app, providing a modern and clean typography.
- **Gradient Background:** The app features a gradient background that transitions from one color to another, creating a visually pleasing backdrop.

## Getting Started
This is a design concept created specifically for iOS and implemented in Xcode using Swift and UIKit, without the use of a storyboard. 
While the design itself is not functional, you can use it as a starting point to develop a functional weather app for iOS. To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up Xcode, which is the primary development environment for iOS app development.
3. Create the necessary view controllers, views, and UI elements to replicate the design within your Xcode project.
4. Implement weather data retrieval and integration with a weather API to display real-time weather information in your app.
5. Customize the design further to add interactivity, user input, and additional features as desired.
6. Integrate a notification icon or badge to provide users with important weather alerts or updates. This can be achieved using iOS's built-in notification mechanisms and frameworks.

## Testing
The application has been tested on the following devices and screen sizes:

- iPhone 11 Pro Max
- iPhone 12
- iPhone 14 Pro
